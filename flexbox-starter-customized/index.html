                Burrow led the Tigers to a 37–10 win in the SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs,
                 securing the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff. He was named the game's Most 
                 Valuable Player (MVP) and during the win, Burrow set the single-season SEC record for passing 
                 touchdowns. Later, on December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, winning 
                 the award by a record-margin of votes.

                In the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw 
                for 463 yards and five passing touchdowns. Burrow also ran for a touchdown in the game and was 
                named the game's offensive MVP, as he led LSU to a 42–25 victory. With the win, LSU finished with 
                an undefeated 15–0 season.

                He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which set the single-season NCAA Division 
                I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) record. The Cincinnati Bengals would indeed draft Burrow first 
                overall in the 2020 NFL Draft. Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, 
                on July 31, 2020. During the off-season and the preseason, Burrow was thought to be the favorite 
                to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.
